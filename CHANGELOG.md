## 2025

#### March 17, 2025
I have started this github repo and made the readme file(I haven't done that before). The next thing to do is to build a Screwdys landing page that uses Github pages to keep it running. I would need to find a way to change the domain name for free.

I made some scribbles on what would the site look like.

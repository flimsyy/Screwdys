# Screwdys
All events that are worth documenting should be on this file

I have started this github repo and made the readme file(I haven't done that before). The next thing to do is to build a Screwdys landing page that uses Github pages to keep it running. I would need to find a way to change the domain name for free.

I made some scribbles on what would the site look like. (As I reflect on this, this looked liked a drawing of a cheeky 5 year old of what his website will look like)

Created the first iteration of the website with just headers and paragraphs. No designs, hyperlinks, or buttons to be seen yet. I'm still learning how to use Github so it took a while to do all of this uploading and documenting. It probably took more time to learn and set it up compared to the time I put into making the website.

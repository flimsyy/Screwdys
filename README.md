# Screwdys
Screwdys is a project that has a goal of offering the people of Brisbane, computer services for completely free in the hopes of myself (and possibly others) getting an actual job out of it.  Whether it would be repairs or upgrades, I would be taking on the task and use the skills that I have to fix any problems that arise.
I would be documenting it here in this repository.
